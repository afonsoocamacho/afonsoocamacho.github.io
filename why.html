            <br>
            <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate__delay-500ms">This project was developed in the context of the World Problem Project, a challenge given to the 1st year CMD students at NHL Stenden. We decided to dive into the whole smartphone scene and see how it messes with our lives. Phones are weird, right? They're awesome for connecting, but they mess with your head sometimes. Our project is about making you think. How do phones affect your brain, relationships, and being in the moment?</p>
            <br>
            <h1 class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate__delay-1s">THE THEME</h1>
            <br>
            <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate__delay-1s">The theme this year was 'Friends and Foe'â€”basically, how your phone can be your best buddy or your worst enemy. Smartphones are everywhere, changing how we live and connect. We wanted to figure out the good and bad stuff, the real deal.</p>
            <br>
            <h1 class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate__delay-2s">The INTERACTIVE VIDEO</h1>
            <br>
            <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate__delay-2s">We thought, let's make it cool and interactive, like how we use our phones every day. So, we made this video where you get to decide what happens. It's like you're in control of the main character's life, especially the smartphone choices.</p>
            <br>
            <h1 class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate__delay-3s">WHY TAKE THE TEST?</h1>
            <br>
            <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate__delay-3s">This WPP thing gave us a chance to talk about the crazy world of smartphones. 'Friends and Foe' is our way of saying, 'Hey, think about your phone habits.' It's more than a project; it's a chat starter about how phones shape our lives. Come join the convo!</p>
